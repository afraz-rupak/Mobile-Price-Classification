# Mobile-Price-Classification
Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to fight tough against big companies like Apple, Samsung, etc.  He does not know how to estimate the price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales data of mobile phones from various companies.  Bob wants to find out some relation between the features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc.) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.  In this problem, you do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is
