# Mobile-Price-Classification

This is s complete Full-Stack Data Science Project which is a Dhaka City Flat's Price Prediction website. At first, I build a model using sklearn and Regression using the Mobile Prices dataset. In the second step, I wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The third component was the website built in HTML, CSS, and javascript that allows users to enter the home square ft area, bedrooms, etc and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building, I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross-validation, etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers:-

1. Python 2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 3. Matplotlib for data visualization 4. Sklearn for model building 5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE 6. Python flask for HTTP server 7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI 8. AWS(EC2-ubuntu) 9. nginx 10. WinSCP
